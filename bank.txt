iii. Find all the customers who have at least two accounts at the Main branch.
SELECT customer_name
 FROM depositor d,account a
 WHERE d.accno=a.accno
 AND a.branch_name='Main'
 GROUP BY d.customer_name
 HAVING COUNT(d.customer_name)>=2;

UPDATE account SET branch_name='Main' WHERE branch_name="b1";
UPDATE account SET branch_name='Main' WHERE branch_name="b2";
UPDATE account SET customer_name='cust1' WHERE customer_name="cust2";

iv. Find all the customers who have an account at all the branches located in a specific city.
SELECT d.customer_name
 FROM account a,branch b,depositor d
 WHERE b.branch_name=a.branch_name AND
 a.accno=d.accno AND
 b.branch_city='c3'
 GROUP BY d.customer_name
 HAVING COUNT(distinct b.branch_name)=(
 SELECT COUNT(branch_name)
 FROM branch
 WHERE branch_city='c3');

v. Demonstrate how you delete all account tuples at every branch located in a specific city.
DELETE FROM account WHERE branch_name IN(SELECT branch_name FROM branch
WHERE branch_city='c5');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
SELECT * FROM account;
